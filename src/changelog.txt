Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2023-08-15
  Balancing:
    - Recipes overhauled. 
    - Loaders are now available shortly after their parent logistics research, rather than near the next tier.
    - Basic and regular loaders use water instead of lubricant; fast loaders use lubricant if the early lubricant recipe is available, or water otherwise.
    - Loaders use 400 water for every 1 lubricant they would have otherwise used.
  Features:
    - Recipe style can now be chosen in startup settings. Replaces old 'adjust base loaders recipe' setting.
    - Added support for Seablock, Circuit Processing, Bob's Electronics, Bob's MCI, and Angel's Petrochem.
    - Adds the early lubricant recipe to Angel's oil processing research if it is not disabled.
  Modding:
    - Loader prototype name format changed: "aai-bobs-<tier>-loader" is now "aai-boblogistics-<tier>-loader".
    - Replaces AAI Loaders' base loaders with ones generated by this mod. 
  Info:
    - Rewrite contributed by Braxbro.
    - Braxbro is now a contributor/maintainer.
